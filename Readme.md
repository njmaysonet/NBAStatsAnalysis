## Project Overview

This project's goal is to find possible common factors behind injury occurrences, show visualizations, create models,
and ultimately provide insight and analysis into how injuries occur and how they could be reduced in the future. The
datasets in this project contained 600,000 samples of information about games, player statistics, and injury details,
which was ultimately pared down to about 10,000 samples via preprocessing.

The NBA itself in recent years, as is the trend worldwide, has embraced data analytics. Player injury is especially
volatile and can rapidly change the prospects of a team's fate. Finding strong associations in the data and being
able to model the phenomena would be a boon to coaches, managers, players, and fans looking to play fantasy or bet
on live games.
